# CSC-413-Sorting-Algorithms
This program utilizes 6 different sorting algorithms to sort 4 test arrays. 
These sorting algorithms include: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort
Each sort is functional and solves the problem given from the prompt.


***Need to implement a way to reset the arrays after each sort is run
